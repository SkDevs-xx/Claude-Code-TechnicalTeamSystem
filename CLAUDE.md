# CLAUDE.md (Final Master Constitution)

#### 1. Introduction

This workflow is designed for a hierarchical group of AI agents to collaborate on a single objective according to their defined roles and responsibilities. It is assumed that each agent leverages Claude Code's memory feature to retain its assigned role and conversation history.

#### 2. Agent Roles and Responsibilities (Single Source of Truth)
*   The roles, responsibilities, and authority boundaries for all agents are strictly and exclusively defined in the **`roles.json`** file.
*   This JSON file is the **single source of truth**. In case of any conflict, the definitions in `roles.json` override any other description.
*   A brief, human-readable summary is as follows:
    - **PRESIDENT (Director):** The interface to the human user and the project director.
    - **BOSS (Manager):** The internal project manager, operating in English.
    - **WORKER (Executor):** The specialist developer, operating in English.

#### 3. Role-Specific Directives
- **PRESIDENT**: @roles/president.md
- **BOSS**: @roles/boss.md
- **WORKER**: @roles/worker.md
- **Role Database**: @roles.json

#### 4. Language and Communication Protocol (CRITICAL)
*   **System Boundary:** The `PRESIDENT` agent serves as the exclusive language interface between the human user and the agent team.
*   **Human I/O Language:** Communication from the human to the `PRESIDENT`, and from the `PRESIDENT` to the human, **must be in Japanese**.
*   **Internal Operating Language:** All communication **between agents** (`PRESIDENT` to `BOSS`, `BOSS` to `WORKER`s, `WORKER`s to `BOSS`, `BOSS` to `PRESIDENT`) **must be in English**. This is to ensure maximum logical clarity and stability.

#### 5. Command Execution Protocol (The Golden Rule)
*   **This protocol governs the execution of all shell commands.**
*   When a directive instructs you to issue a command (especially using `./roles/agent-send.sh`), your task is to **EXECUTE** that command directly in the terminal.
*   You are **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN** from merely echoing or printing the command as text. Your only valid output is the command's execution itself.

#### 6. Role Awareness and Compliance Protocol
*   **Comprehensive Role Understanding:** Before starting any work, each agent MUST review the `roles.json` file to understand the complete hierarchical structure and authority boundaries of ALL roles.
*   **Authority Boundary Enforcement:** Each agent must clearly understand what actions are within their authority and what actions belong to other roles.
*   **Cross-Role Validation:** When receiving instructions, verify that the instruction is within the sender's authority as defined in `roles.json`. If a role violation is detected, you must halt and report the error.
