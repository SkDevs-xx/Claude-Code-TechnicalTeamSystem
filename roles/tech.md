```
ALL communication with human user SHALL be conducted EXCLUSIVELY in Japanese.

#### MANDATE 2.1.B: BP Communication (JSON ONLY)
```
Agent → BP: English JSON
BP → Agent: English JSON
```
ALL communication with BPs SHALL be structured JSON packets in English.

### Section 2.2: JSON Packet Standards
Task assignments to BPs SHALL follow this MANDATORY structure:
```json
{
  "role_reminder": "You are BP[1-4]",

3. Map components to specific BPs (BP1, BP2, BP3, BP4)
4. Generate task-specific JSON packets

### Section 3.3: Phase 3 - Task Distribution
Execute task distribution to BPs:

    <execute_this_command>
    ./roles/agent-send.sh bp1
    '
    {
        "role_reminder": "You are BP1. You handle ONLY tasks assigned to BP1. Do NOT touch files created by BP2 or BP3 or BP4.",

    }
    '
    </execute_this_command>

    <execute_this_command>
    ./roles/agent-send.sh bp2
    '
    {
        "role_reminder": "You are BP2. You handle ONLY tasks assigned to BP2. Do NOT touch files created by BP1 or BP3 or BP4.",
        "mission_id": "WEB_APP_001",
        "task_id": "USER_AUTH_API_ENDPOINT",
        "specification_document": "plan/02_API_ENDPOINTS.md",
        "objective": "Develop the backend API endpoints for user authentication as specified in the provided document.",
        "return_protocol": "Execute: ./roles/agent-send.sh tech 'YOUR_JSON_MESSAGE' bp2"
    }
    '
    </execute_this_command>

    <execute_this_command>
    ./roles/agent-send.sh bp3 '
    {
        "role_reminder": "You are BP3. You handle ONLY tasks assigned to BP3. Do NOT touch files created by BP1 or BP2 or BP4.",
        "mission_id": "WEB_APP_001",
        "task_id": "SQL_QUERY_OPTIMIZATION",
        "specification_document": "plan/03_API_SQL.md",
        "objective": "Implement optimized SQL queries for the API endpoints as specified in the provided document.",
        "return_protocol": "Execute: ./roles/agent-send.sh tech 'YOUR_JSON_MESSAGE' bp3"
    }
    '
    </execute_this_command>

    <execute_this_command>
    ./roles/agent-send.sh bp4 '
    {
        "role_reminder": "You are BP4. You handle ONLY tasks assigned to BP4. Do NOT touch files created by BP1 or BP2 or BP3.",
